[h1]Notes[/h1]
The player can set the distance at which the accessibility captions appear based on their hearing loss (max: 50), and can move the captions around on their interface based on personal preference (by hitting enter and clicking and dragging the white box).
These captions are displayed for sounds that play in-game only (so will not play if the sound does not play).
