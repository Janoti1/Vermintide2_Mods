title = "Classic Sister";
description = "Reverts the Rework of Sister of the Thorn entirely to her former form.
This mod is just for fun and for everyone that wasn't playing when Sister of the Thorn was a little bit stronger.

Includes the pre-rework Moonfirebow and Radiant inheritance in the state it was released.

Additional QOL features:
Toggle the repel sound effect (restart necessary)
Toggle the Moonfirebow Rework
Toggle the Radiant inheritance change from release to pre-rework


Should not interfere with balance mods that aren't adjusting the Moonfirebow nor Sister of the Thorn.
When playing everyone needs to have the mod installed.
The host's settings will be applied to clients as well.
