[h1]Functionality[/h1]

This mod is just for fun and for everyone that wasn't playing when Sister of the Thorn was a little bit stronger.
Reverts the rework of Sister of the Thorn entirely to her former form. Also reverts Moonfire Bow and Javelins to previous Patches. 


[h1]Options[/h1]

[h3]Radiant Inheritance on Release. (Nerfed within a week after release)[/h3]

[h3]Radiant Inheritance pre-rework. (Nerfed together with shade rework)[/h3]

[h3]Moonfire Bow pre-rework. (Nerfed together with shade rework)[/h3]

[h3]Javelins. (Nerfed with 5.2.0, Balance Patch Dec 2023)[/h3]

[h3]Disable Repel's sound effect.[/h3]


[h1]Notes[/h1]

Should not interfere with balance mods that aren't adjusting the Moonfirebow, Javelins or Sister of the Thorn.
When playing everyone needs to have the mod installed.
The host's settings will be applied to clients as well.
