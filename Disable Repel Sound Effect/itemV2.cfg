title = "Disable Repel Sound Effect";
description = "
This Mod disables the sound effect of the talent "Repel" by the forth career "Sister of The Thorn" from Kerillian.
It will only get disabled for clients.
Does not interfere with balance mods as long as they dont change the talent itself.
Enabling the sound effect again requires a restart and turining off the mod in the launcher.

This functionality is part of the "Classic Sister" Mod: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2780042088
