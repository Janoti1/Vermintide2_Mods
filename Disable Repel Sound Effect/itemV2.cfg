[h1]Functionality[/h1]
This Mod disables the sound effect of the talent Repel by the career Sister of The Thorn from Kerillian.
It will only get disabled for yourself.
Does not interfere with balance mods as long as they dont change the talent itself.

This functionality is originally part of the mod [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2780042088]Classic Sister[/url].

[h1]Options[/h1]
The sound effect can be toggled on or off in the mod's setting in the game.
