Event Practice 2.0 slightly updates the classic mod eventpracticev2 by Craven ( https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2448641329 )

Added Stuff:
- assign keybind to jump to the next event ( /toevent )
- added missing events and adjusted teleport points including the latest two maps (Treachery DLC)
- toggle and move all ui elements freely
- adjust font size of pacing ui element
- toggle loot rats for teleporting
- toggle chat prompts for spawning hordes when ui elements are active
- Added teleport in the keep to teleport to the Bridge of Shadows
- Skittergate: Teleporting straight to the end event for practice is now possible (respawns wont work unfortunately). To start the event type /skittergate_initiate ideally delete all enemies for a few seconds then type /skittergate_start . 
Deleting enemies is not needed to start the event, however it will improve performance. 
Teleporting to the middle event, starting it and proceeding to the end event is not possible, without having used the lever of the first lift AND the lever for the portal.

TODO:
- Adjust Respawn mechanics to adjust for events
- Add comands for practicing trails of treachery (so far I have not found a way to do this)


General Description:
- Tool for practicing events. 
- Has a table of saved teleport locations for each map. 
- Type /toevent and you will teleport to the first event. Type it again you will go to the second and so on. 
- Replaces boss triggers with sackrats so you don't have to delete all enemies and can get a more authentic event (the bosses are only replaced when you use the /toevent command so no issue having this mod on while playing the game). 
- Type /startFOWAtWave <number (1-8)> - Start FOW at entered wave and will continue from there to end

- Debug information about horde composition and pacing in the f4 menu.
- Type /getLocationData for debugging.


All Crredits and Rights etc go to Craven
