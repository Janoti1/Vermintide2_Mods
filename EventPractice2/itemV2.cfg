Event Practice 2.0 updates the classic mod [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2448641329]eventpracticev2[/url] by Craven.


[h1]Functionality[/h1]
This is a tool for practicing events and displaying information about key game mechanics such as pacing, intensity and threat.


[h1]Use[/h1]
You can teleport to any events by pressing a button or using the command [b]/toevent[/b]. (pressing it again will teleport you to the next event etc)
You can replace boss triggers with sackrats to have items for the event.
You can practice the map Fortunes of War by using [b]/startFOWAtWave <number (1-8)>[/b] in the map.
You can toggle chat outputs for the name of the horde composition that spawns. In addition to that you can use [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2931972625]Show Terror Events And Hordes[/url] for more details about the events.
You can toggle three different windows and adjust their position on your screen displaying the [b]Horde Composition[/b], [b]Pacing Details[/b] and [b]Intensity Details[/b].
You can type [b]/getLocationData[/b] to get the exact coordinates of your current position.
You can teleport to the Bridge of Shadows in the Keep.


[h1]Notes[/h1]
[b]Skittergate[/b]: Teleporting straight to the end event for practice is now possible (respawns wont work unfortunately). To start the event type [b]/skittergate_initiate[/b] ideally delete all enemies for a few seconds then type [b]/skittergate_start[/b]. 
Deleting enemies is not needed to start the event, however it will improve performance.
Teleporting to the middle event, starting it and proceeding to the end event is not possible, without having used the lever of the first lift AND the lever for the portal.

[b]Trail of Treachery[/b]: Teleports have been placed, however you wont be able to practice the events without moving the sleigh.

[b]A Grudge Served Cold[/b]: Has a teleport to the bomb wagon. The wagon is not mandatory to trigger for the final event, however it helps for practice.

[b]Khazukan Kazakit-Ha[/b]: To start the end event you will have to repair the pipe and light the fire (yes the random teleport in between is unfortunately necessary).

[b]A Parting of the Waves[/b]: The first teleport allows you to walk a bit forward, to remove the first mission objective for the rest of the map. It is not mandatory to play the events.
