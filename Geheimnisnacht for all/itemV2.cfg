This mod adds the ritual side of the three-eyed watcher to all adventure maps.

Thanks to Craven for providing the code of his previous mod:

Big shoutout to Isaakk who helped me fix the mod when it was broken.

The Skull is changing the following multipliers:
125% damage dealt
225% max health
110% stagger resistance
190% hit mass

let me know if you can truly find ALL the maps with a ritual. xD

The source code is available in the steam workshop folder.
