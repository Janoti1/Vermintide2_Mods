[h1][u]Description:[/u][/h1]
This is a balance mod aiming for modded difficulties, so even though Handmaiden is fairly strong in the official realm, we gave her a lot of needed Buffs.
Currently in high modded diffculties with Live Balance or Tourney Balance Testing Handmaiden lacks [u]sustain[/u] like no damage recuction or the capability to regain thp quickly and [u]control[/u] such as the stagger or killing power to be a sufficient frontliner. 
This mod provides her multiple sustain options and plenty of killing power while also offering extra utility in the form of various teamauras to compete with other frontliners.
Most talents keep their functionality, and most new talents are returns of older talents rather than completely new.


[h1][u]Use:[/u][/h1]
This mod CAN be used alongside Tourney Balance or [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2780042088]Classic Sister[/url], however everyone in the party will NEED to have Handmaiden The Everqueen installed in order to make it work!
