[h1]Notes[/h1]
Pause - Pausing the game still allows you to interact with menus, however players can't join while paused.
Invisible - Only makes the player using it invisible.
Giga Power - Essentially increases the Enhanced Power talent of each career. Reequip the talent whenever you toggle this command.
Crit Chance - The Value will be set for each career individually, however reset upon restarting the game.
Movement Speed - The Value will be reset upon restarting the game.
Time - Pausing and restarting the game will reset the previously set time. The numbers reflect set values in a list of the source code which can be found [url=https://github.com/Aussiemon/Vermintide-2-Source-Code/blob/dafc183b5b4c6f4940b055b6365a8436d9e43552/scripts/managers/debug/debug_manager.lua#L18]here[/url]
Ult - Ult times can only be reduced to a value lower than the maximum cooldown length of the career. Turning on ult time adjustments for players or bots will cause the game to not be savely reloadable when modding in the developer mode.


[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2477335429]Restart Level[/url] also introduces commands for restarting etc in case this mod is turned on these commands of [b]Hacks[/b] will be disabled.
[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1393694530]Spawn Tweaks[/url] also adds a infinite ammo option. The option provided by Spawn Tweaks will be made unusable by [b]Hacks[/b].
