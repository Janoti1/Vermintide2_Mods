[h1]This is a mod for other modders.[/h1]

This Mod allows the convertion of strings to murmur hashes as they are used by the game,
and the convertion from hashes to their inverted original string value for further use in other mods.

This functionality has been part of the [url=https://gitlab.com/lschwiderski/vt2_bundle_unpacker]VT2 Bundle Unpacker[/url] for some time but was not accessible in the game itself.

The inverse hash is not the original string that was used to create a hash. Instead, it is a string of fixed length that, when hashed with Murmur, creates a hash identical to <input>.
While the primary version of the hash function operates on and creates 64-bit hashes, the engine sometimes uses 32-bit hashes. However, while a separate algorithm does exist, the game instead simply creates a 64-bit hash and cuts off the second half.

[h1]Functionality[/h1]
Create a hash value from a string:
/murmur_hash <string_to_hash>

Create an inversed hash value from a hash:
/murmur_inverse <hash_hi> <hash_lo>

The has value has to be split in its hi and lo part eg
0C5CF5FB0717AFCB --> hash_hi = 0x0C5CF5FB, hash_lo = 0x0717AFCB
