[h1]Functionality[/h1]

Type /open_inventory in the chat or assign a keybind (default I) to open the inventory in game.

Adds part of the functionality of the mod [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1391228174]Ui Improvements[/url] and adds to it so you can change equipment on careers you are not currently playing but also swap to them whilst in the game when they are currently visible in the inventory by a press of a button.

Pressing the change button (purple button resembling a refresh icon) when you are currently seeing your own career in the inventory will save  you from ledges, disablers or when able to beeing rescued.


[h1]Notes[/h1]

Users with the new UI will only be able to change their Weapons, Charm, Trinket and Neklace slots.
Will not work properly with Ui Improvements turned on.
