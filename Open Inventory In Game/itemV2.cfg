Opens a UI Window alongside your Inventory that allows you to swap to every career (that you own) in the game.
Also allows you to rescue yourself from ledges, disablers and when beeing able to get rescued.

Users with the new UI will only be able to change their Weapons, Charm, Trinket and Neklace slots.
