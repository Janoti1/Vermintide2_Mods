[h1]Use[/h1]
Go into the VMF menu (F4 by default) look for the mod and select a map from the two dropdowns. Then select a difficulty and click Load Selected.
The selected level will now be loaded with the selected difficulty.

Additionally there are three commands for use for experienced users:

[b]/load_level[/b] allows you to load a level by its level_key 
(be aware there are issues and many might not work)

[b]/set_difficulty[/b] allows you to set the difficulty of the current level 
(be aware all already spawned enemies will not change)

[b]/current_level[/b] displays the level_key of the level you are in


[h1]Notes[/h1]
'versus_base' is the difficulty used in versus games.
