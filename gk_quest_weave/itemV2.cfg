[h1][u]Grail Knight Quest Fix[/u][/h1]


This Mod Fixes a few bugs and problems Grail Knight's Passive Quest Talent has had for a long time.

- fixes the objective grims in weaves to be collect 30% of the levels essence for heal regen
- fixes the objective tomes in weaves to be kill infantry
- adjusts numbers of how many enemies have to be killed for a strength pot in weaves (about 1/2 less now)
- adjusts numbers of how many enemies have to be killed for a strength pot in chaos wastes (about 1/3 more now)
- removes quests resetting after each stage in chaos wastes (once you complete one they stay until the very end of the pilgrimage)
- removes the grim quest from a quiet drink and fow, replaces the tome quest with one that needs the player to kill a certain amount of infantry units
- small description changes


Besides These Bug Fixes, this Mod also tried to Balance out The Strength Pot Quest of Grail Knight Depending on what Onslaught Difficutly is Enabled:

- There is a Checkbox in the Mod Settings  that allows you to turn the Kill amount adjustment on or off (requires restart of mission or changing career and swapping back to grail knight by using open inventory)
- The Values are subject to change depending on how it plays in Game; Feedback is welcome

The Values and how I got to them can be found here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1C_-ElCCkf83mBTp9IPazz_9IylywAbySDcFBu8hCiFs/edit#gid=0
